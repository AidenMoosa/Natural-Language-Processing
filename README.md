# Natural Language Processing Task 1

This assignment saw us reproduce the famous paper by Pang et al (2002) that expands on simple Naïve Bayes BoW-based sentiment classification of movie reviews. The changes explored were the use of Support Vector Machines, which outperforms Naïve Bayes in many NLP tasks, as well as some slight implementation modifications. 

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### Prerequisites

* sklearn (0.19)
* nltk (3.3)

### Installing

* Download and install the prerequisite libraries (e.g. using pip).
* Clone the repo onto your workspace.

## Running the tests

* Use source code editing software to change variables at the top of the source code in order to modify the parameters (e.g. whether to use stemming or not) of the system.
* Run the source code with any Python 3(.7) interpreter in order to receive a printed summary of the results gathered from training and testing the NB and SVM models.
